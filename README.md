A simple integration of Shoket's Payments API into your Laravel application.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require shoket/laravel-shoket
```

<!-- You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-shoket-migrations"
php artisan migrate
``` -->

<!-- You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-shoket-config"
``` -->

<!-- This is the contents of the published config file:

```php

    // ...
];
``` -->

## Usage

Using the Shoket Facade is easy. You can use the `Shoket::receive([...])` method to accept payments.

```php
use Shoket\Facades\Shoket;
echo Shoket::receive([
    'amount' => '10.00',
    'network' => 'tigo'
    ]);
```
